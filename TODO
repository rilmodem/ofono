Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


SMS
===

- Add support for Enhanced SMS (EMS) from 3GPP 23.040.  These SMS messages
  support a richer set of formatting elements, including bold/italic and
  font size selection.  Embedding images and sounds into the SMS is also
  supported.  This task should add support for receiving such SMS messages.

  Proposed solution is to convert such messages to HTML and embed image /
  sound data as embedded MIME in the generated HTML stream.  The EMS messages
  will have to be detected (by the presence of particular tags in the SMS)
  and signaled separately from simple SMS messages.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- See / Cancel pending SMS messages over DBus.  When oFono sends SMS messages
  the method call is only returned when the message has been submitted to the
  network.  Instead we should return an object path and allow cancellation of
  pending messages.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Yang Gu <yang.gu@intel.com>

- Asynchronously acknowledge SMS DELIVER messages sent by the SMS driver
  to core using ofono_sms_deliver_notify().  This may require the struct
  ofono_sms_driver to be extended with one more function pointer like:
    void (*deliver_ack)(unsigned char *pdu, int len, cb_t cb, void *data)
  because currently messages are automatically acknowledged by either the
  modem (this is the case of some AT modems) or the driver right after
  ofono_sms_deliver_notify() and a failure to deliver at an upper level is
  ignored.  The PDU can be an RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message with optional
  TP-User-Content element, for example if returned from USIM Data Download.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

SIM / SIM File system
=====================

- SIM Call History plugin.  New UICCs support four new SIM elementary files
  for storing call history information on the SIM: EFici, EFict, EFoci, EFoct.
  A plugin should be developed for oFono that will write to these files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for SIM 'ready' notifications from the driver to the core.  Most
  modem manufacturers initialize the SIM (e.g. cache SIM file system, STK
  initialization, etc) internally before allowing the telephony stack to
  access these portions.  When the PIN is locked, this can lead to oFono being
  too fast for the modem and asking it for things before the firmware is ready.

  The proposal is to introduce a new sim function:
    void ofono_sim_ready_notify(struct ofono_sim *sim);

  When oFono determines the SIM PIN is READY, it checks whether
  ofono_sim_ready_notify has been called.  If it hasn't, then it stalls the
  initialization procedure (and calling post_sim) until
  ofono_sim_ready_notify is called.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>

- Check SIM pin status if sim_change_pin fails. If it is anything other than
  READY, we must tear the state back to pre_sim state and set the modem offline.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Marit Henriksen <marit.henriksen@stericsson.com>

- Add support for CPHS Customer Service Profile (CSP).  This task adds support
  for reading the EFcsp file and in particular, interpreting the PLMN mode bit
  within the 'Value Added Services' service group.

  Based on the PLMN mode value, manual network selection needs to either be
  enabled or disabled in the netreg atom.  Also to accommodate this, there
  probably needs to be a new 'forced' mode to indicate that manual network
  selection is disabled.

  Priority: Medium

  ISIM is the SIM application for IP Multimedia Subsystem, specified in
  3GPP TS 31.103. The UICCs can support multiple ISIMs for different IMS
  identities.

  Priority: Low

Flight Mode
===========

- Flight Mode support.  Add an 'Online' property to the Modem interface that
  will control the online state of the modem.  When Online state is True all
  atoms are available.  When Online state is False, all network related items
  are removed (e.g. CallSettings) or enter into reduced functionality set
  where only the SIM is available (e.g. DataConnectionManager, SimManager, etc)

- Call forwarding state handling change

  At the moment call forwarding states are not always correct. Any active
  conditional call forwarding should become quiescent while unconditional call
  forwarding is activate. If call forwarding unconditional is subsequently
  deactivated, all the quiescent forwardings should become operative again.
  I.e. No conditional call forwardin string should be returned while
  unconditional call forwarding is active even if they exist.

  If there is an successful attempt to activate/deactivate conditional call
  forwarding while unconditional call forwarding is active the conditional cache
  flag should cleared.

  automatic calling repeat call attempt restrictions.

  There should be a method to manually reset blacklisting.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1


Sim Toolkit
===========

- Support Refresh proactive command.  The specification defines 7 types
  of Refresh types:
	- NAA Initialization
	- NAA File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and Full File Change Notification
	- UICC Reset
	- NAA Application Reset (2G only)
	- NAA Session Reset (3G only)

  The 'NAA Initialization' type will be ignored by oFono, it is assumed
  this is handled by the modem.

  For 'UICC Reset', 'NAA Application Reset' and 'NAA Session Reset' oFono
  will first check whether there are any calls or ussd operations active.
  If there are, the appropriate response will be sent (e.g. busy on call
  or screen busy terminal response.)  Otherwise a positive response will be
  sent to the driver.  In the case of a 'UICC Reset' the driver / modem
  can interpret this that it is safe to reset the UICC.

  Alternatively, the driver / modem can notify the core of the SIM removal
  / SIM insertion events without using the Refresh proactive command.  It
  is up to the driver / modem to perform a warm reset.  In particular, 3GPP
  31.111 mandates that any change to EFimsi is done by using 'UICC Reset',
  'NAA Application Reset' or 'NAA Session Reset'.  Please see 3GPP 31.111
  Section 6.4.7.1.

  Other types will be handled by oFono flushing the EF cache of the files
  affected (or the entire SIM cache in case of Full File Change Notifications)
  and re-reading the affected files.  Any properties derived from these
  Elementary Files will be updated and signaled using PropertyChanged.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C8

- Support of the BIP (Bearer Independent Protocol) proactive commands.
  The specification defines several bearer types. For now, only the packet data
  service bearer is considered.

	- OPEN CHANNEL: requests the terminal to open a data channel with
	parameters indicated in the command. A user confirmation may be
	requested by the SimToolkitAgent.
	- CLOSE CHANNEL:requests the terminal to close the specified data
	channel.
	- RECEIVE DATA:requests the terminal to return to the UICC data
	received on the specified channel.
	- SEND DATA:requests the terminal to send on the specified channel data
	provided by the UICC.
	- GET CHANNEL STATUS: requests the terminal to return the current
	status of all available data channels.

Emergency Calls
===============

- Modem Emergency mode.  Support network registration and online/offline
  mode during the emergency calls and related network activity (e.g.,
  network-initiated location request via supplementary service channel).

  Proposed solution is to introduce a new Emergency boolean property to the
  Modem D-Bus interface and new functions to modem interface:

  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_inc()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_get()
  - ofono_modem_add_emergency_mode_watch()
  - ofono_modem_remove_emergency_mode_watch()

  When emergency mode is requested, modem is set to online (if needed) and
  the watchers are notified. There can be multiple parties requesting
  emergency mode.  When all of them have completed the emergency-related
  operation and called ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec(), modem is set to
  offline (if needed) and the watchers are again notified.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Country / Operator specific emergency numbers.  Figure out how to support
  countries / operators with specific mandated emergency numbers which are
  not part of the standard emergency number list. This needs to be queried
  by the voicecall atom every time a new SIM is inserted.  The list is
  assumed to be managed by the modem.  If no such functionality is available,
  then the 3GPP mandated behavior is used.

  Owner: Dara Spieker-Doyle <dara.spieker-doyle@nokia.com>

- Add support for Three-Way Calling over a CDMA network. Three-Way Calling
  provides the subscriber with the capability to add a third party to an
  established two-party call, so that all three parties may communicate in a
  three-way call.

  In CDMA mode, the originating subscriber of a current conversation can
  request for a third party to be added to a conversation by sending a Flash
  With Information Message (FWIM) with dialed digits to the network. Upon
  setting up a two-way conversation with the added party, the originating
  subscriber can request to establish a three-way conversation by sending
  another Flash With Information Message. Upon receiving the second Flash With
  Information Message, the MSC reconnects the original party to the
  conversation thus completing the setup of a three-way conversation.

  CDMA Three-Way Calling is described by Figure B-5 in 3GPP2 C.S0005-E Version
  2.0.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for Call Waiting over a CDMA network. Call Waiting (CW) provides
  notification of an incoming call to an originating subscriber, while the
  subscriber's call is in the 2-way state. Subsequently, the originating
  subscriber can either answer or ignore the incoming call. If the originating
  subscriber answers the second call, it may alternate between the two calls.

  In CDMA mode, the originating subscriber of a current conversation will
  receive either a Flash With Information Message or an Alert With Information
  Message from the network if there is an additional mobile terminated voice
  call incoming. The originating subscriber can change conversation parties by
  sending a Flash With Information Message to the network and the MSC will
  toggle the speech path between the two conversations.

  CDMA Call Waiting is described by Figure B-6 in 3GPP2 C.S0005-E Version
  2.0.

  can be used to replace the international access prefix when dialing. When
  received, transmitted or stored, an international indicator can be included
  with the address digits although it is the responsibility of the network to
  ignore the international indicator when attached to a national number. This
  is described in Section 2.7.1.3.2.4 of 3GPP2 C.S0005-E v2.0 and Section 1.2

  the number to be dialed in reply to a received SMS message.

  In transmit direction, oFono allows setting of Call-Back Number. If the
  Call Back Number property is set, CDMA SMS stack will encode Call-Back
  Number subparameter in the Submit Message.

  In receiving direction, oFono will process the Call-Back Number
  subparameter in the incoming Deliver Message and notify UI of the
  Call-Back Number together with the newly received text message.
