Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


SMS
===

- Add support for Enhanced SMS (EMS) from 3GPP 23.040.  These SMS messages
  support a richer set of formatting elements, including bold/italic and
  font size selection.  Embedding images and sounds into the SMS is also
  supported.  This task should add support for receiving such SMS messages.

  Proposed solution is to convert such messages to HTML and embed image /
  sound data as embedded MIME in the generated HTML stream.  The EMS messages
  will have to be detected (by the presence of particular tags in the SMS)
  and signaled seperately from simple SMS messages.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Source / Destination port addressing scheme from 3GPP 23.040.  A special
  header is used to indicate the source / destination port of the application
  this SMS message belongs to.  Such messages which are encoded in 8-bit should
  be decoded by oFono automatically.  The handler associated with this source /
  destination port is called with the decoded stream.

  Proposed solution involves a registration / callback framework in the SMS
  atom for plugins to register handlers.  Default (wildcard) handler is also
  desired.

- Smart Messaging Service.  This is a separate standard from Nokia and uses
  the 3GPP 23.040 source / destination addressing scheme.  The main aim of
  this task is to support vCards and vCalendar objects over SMS.

  Proposed solution is to add a plugin with an extension API to send / receive
  such messages.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Depends: Source / Destination port scheme

- WAP PUSH notification support for MMS.  oFono should be able to receive
  WAP PUSH messages over SMS, parse them and report them to the upper level
  MMS stack.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- See / Cancel pending SMS messages over DBus.  When oFono sends SMS messages
  the method call is only returned when the message has been submitted to the
  network.  Instead we should return an object path and allow cancellation of
  pending messages.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Persist outgoing SMS messages.  Currently oFono persists incoming messages
  that are fragmented.  However oFono does not persist queued outgoing
  messages.  oFono should persist such messages and restore / requeue them
  on the next oFono startup.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- Better unique ID for incoming / outgoing messages.  Currently oFono uses
  a simple incremental counter stored in the settings store (NextMessageId).
  This tends to break quite easily in strange situations (e.g. forced battery
  removal, unexpected crashes).  This makes the uniqueness of this ID not
  always guaranteed.

  Proposed solution is to base the ID on SHA1 or MD5 hash.  Hash the contents
  of the message + reception / sent time and the sender / originator address.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- SMS Status Report support support according to 3GPP 23.040.  oFono should
  support SMS start reports.  For fragmented SMS messages oFono should take
  care of collating the status reports for each fragment and notifying once
  all fragments are received.

  SMS call history should be updated with support of SMS 'delivered' or
  'undeliverable' status.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

SIM / SIM File system
=====================

- Fixed Dialing support.  oFono should support Fixed Dialing Numbers.  This
  requires being able to edit the FD phonebook or assume that the FD phonebook
  has been appropriately bootstrapped.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Barred Numbers.  oFono should support Barred Numbers capability.  This
  requires ability to read & write EFadn entries on the SIM.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

- Read / Write EFcfis.  Call forwarding settings can be bootstrapped on the
  SIM for faster notification of the user that call forwarding is active.
  These settings are stored in EFcfis.  oFono should read these settings and
  update the call history atom appropriately.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- SIM Call History plugin.  New UICCs support four new SIM elementary files
  for storing call history information on the SIM: EFici, EFict, EFoci, EFoct.
  A plugin should be developed for oFono that will write to these files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Support proprietory extensions for SIM PIN retry counter.  Most vendors
  provide an extension commands to obtain such a retry counter for PINs and
  PUKs.  Need to enable this as a property in oFono.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2


Modem Emulator
==============

- Support HFP AG emulator.  We should provide a new HFP_AG_EMULATOR atom type
  that will implement the Bluetooth HFP AG profile.  Voicecall atom, netreg
  atoms can register command handlers for this atom appropriately.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

- Support extensions to HFP AG emulator.  Some carkits support additional
  AT command extensions to the Bluetooth HFP AG standard.  Refer to CE4A
  white paper: "AT-commands for Automotive Premium Phone Integration".
  Plugins can register additional command handlers appropriately to handle
  such commands.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium
  Depends: HFP AG emulator

- Support HSP AG.  Similar to HFP AG emulator but implements the much reduced
  Bluetooth HSP AG profile.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Support DUN emulator. Implement the Bluetooth DUN profile with only mandatory
  AT command support.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

  Depends: PPP Server mode

- Support Bluetooth SPP profile.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium


Flight Mode
===========

- Flight Mode support.  Add an 'Online' property to the Modem interface that
  will control the online state of the modem.  When Online state is True all
  atoms are available.  When Online state is False, all network related items
  are removed (e.g. CallSettings) or enter into reduced functionality set
  where only the SIM is available (e.g. DataConnectionManager, SimManager, etc)

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: High

GPRS
====

- PPP Server support.  Extend GAtPPP to support PPP Server role, similarly to
  how existing GSM modems support PPP GPRS contexts.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Zhenhua Zhang <zhenhua.zhang@intel.com>

- On-demand SOCKS5 proxy support for MMS contexts.  When an MMS context type
  is created, oFono should create a SOCKS5 proxy.  When a client connects to
  the proxy, oFono can activate the GPRS context on-demand.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for GPRS suspended event.  Expose this to the UI by adding a new
  'Suspended' property on the DataConnectionManager D-Bus interface.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- Add support for IPv6 GPRS contexts.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1


Location Services
=================

- Neighbor Cell Info.  Add dedicated atom, D-Bus API and atom driver(s) for
  Neighbor Cell information.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium


Supplementary Services
======================

- Closed User Group (CUG) support.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) support

  Priority: Low

- User to User Signaling (UUS) support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Multiple Subscriber Profile (MSP) support

  Priority: Low

- Called Line Identification.  This affects both call_settings and voicecall
  atoms.  3GPP service is accessed by the +CDIP command.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

- CPHS Support.  This includes ALS and CPHS specific elementary files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8


Voicecall
=========

- Supplementary service notifications on remote party actions:
  - call has been put on hold (+CSSU: 2)
  - call has been retrieved (+CSSU: 3), and
  - joining call to a multiparty conference (+CSSU: 4)

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>

- Dial strings. Include CLIR prefixes and 2nd stage dial strings in the
  DialString call property. Add dialstring accessor method to C API.

  Priority: Medium

- Provide feedback of sent DTMF tones. Emit SendingTones signal if modem can
  provide approximate starting and stopping times for DTMF tones. Signal
  argument contains a string of DTMF tones to be sent, or empty string when
  all tones has been sent.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>


Miscellaneous
=============

- Country / Operator specific emergency numbers.  Figure out how to support
  countries / operators with specific mandated emergency numbers which are
  not part of the standard emergency number list. This needs to be queried
  by the voicecall atom every time a new SIM is inserted.  The list is
  assumed to be managed by the modem.  If no such functionality is available,
  then the 3GPP mandated behavior is used.

  Complexity: C2
  Priority: High

- Bluetooth SAP Client support.  The Telit UC864-G devices support Bluetooth
  SAP client mode.  This requires the use of a modem side-channel to read the
  APDU & CPDU data and send it to the remote phone device over Bluetooth RFCOMM
  channel.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Low

- Frequency Band Selection.  Add frequency band selection capability to the
  RadioSettings atom.

  Complexity: C2
  Priority: Low

- PolicyKit support.  Add support for PolicyKit checking of all oFono D-Bus
  interfaces.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Low

- Internet Access Provider database.  Have oFono automatically configure
  GPRS contexts based on an internal database.  Database format to be decided.
  If there are multiple matches in the database, then some user intervention
  might be required.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C8

- Support for modem 'silent' reset notifications.  oFono will remove all atoms
  and re-initialize.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for Modem 'power down & lock' and 'unlock & power up'.  When the
  'power down & lock' is given, the calling application is noted and all
  other applications are blocked from powering up the modem.  Only the calling
  application can lift the lock.  Alternatively, if the calling application
  exits prematurely the lock is lifted as well.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add a property for Automatic Idle (sometimes referred to as Fast Dormancy)
  in the RadioSettings atom.  This property will enable or disable the use of
  automatic connection release by the modem for power consumption reasons.
  This is a major power-saving feature for phones, but can be ignored for USB
  sticks or PCI devices.

  If the modem does not support such a feature the property should never be
  exposed to the user.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- Extend the voicecall interface with a property indicating whether this call
  is an emergency call (essentially the CLI matches one of the numbers on the
  emergency calling codes list.)

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- TTY (hearing impaired) support.  Add a new oFono atom type that will enable
  the user to enable or disable the TTY support on the modem.  Support for
  automatic detection of TTY (signaled by the driver) is also desired.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1
