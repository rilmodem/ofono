This README describes the upstream rilmodem/ofono git repository hosted on 
github:

https://github.com/rilmodem/ofono

The original ofono README is still present, however it's been re-named 
README.orig.

This git repository is a temporary fork of ofono 1.12 meant as a staging
area for work on rilmodem, an ofono driver and associated plugins used 
to provide a telephony stack based upon an Android RILD instance ( vs. a
native modem driver ).  This repository is *also* the upstream for Ubuntu's
version of ofono.  As such, changes to this repository must be tested 
to ensure no regressions are introduced.  For rilmodem-related changes,
it's recommended that they be tested on at least one of the Nexus-based
phones currently supported by Ubuntu Touch.

The 'master' branch is auto-imported to the following Launchpad bzr branch:

https://code.launchpad.net/~phablet-team/ofono/rilmodem

The packaging branch is:

https://code.launchpad.net/~phablet-team/ofono/ubuntu

It's the intention of the developers of this code to work with the
ofono developers to eventually upstream this code, however as there is
still work to be done ( missing core features, code cleanup, unit tests,
... ), this repository has been created to make cross-distro colloboration
on rilmodem easier.
