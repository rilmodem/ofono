Radio settings hierarchy
========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.RadioSettings
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all radio access properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.NotImplemented
					 [service].Error.Failed

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as readwrite are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.NotImplemented
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string TechnologyPreference [readwrite]

			The current radio access selection mode, also known
			as network preference.

			The possible values are:
				"any"	Radio access technology
					selection is done automatically,
					based on reception and
					availability.
				"gsm"	Only GSM used for radio access.
				"umts"	Only UMTS used for radio access.
				"lte"	Only LTE used for radio access.

			NOTE: In Ubuntu for Phones branch the description above
			is no longer valid. Usage of "any" is deprecated and,
			after setting the property, RAT selection will be done
			automatically based on reception and availability among
			the selected technology *and* less advanced
			technologies. For instance, if preference is "umts",
			at a given moment we could be registered in a gsm or
			umts network, but never in an lte one.

		array{string} AvailableTechnologies [readonly, optional]

			List of values for TechnologyPreference property
			supported by the modem.

		string GsmBand [readwrite, optional]

			Frequency band in which the modem is allowed to
			operate when using "gsm" mode. Setting this property
			has an immediate effect on modem only if
			TechnologyPreference is set to "gsm" or "any".
			Otherwise the value is kept and applied whenever modem
			uses this mode.

			The possible values are:
				"any"	Frequency band is selected
					automatically by modem.
				"850"	Operate only on 850 MHz.
				"900P"	Operate only on 900 MHz, known as
					Primary GSM-900 Band
				"900E"	Operate only on 900 MHz, known as
					Extended GSM-900 Band.
				"1800"	Operate only on 1800 MHz, known as DCS.
				"1900"	Operate only on 1900 MHz, known as PCS.

		string UmtsBand [readwrite, optional]

			Frequency band in which the modem is allowed to
			operate when using "umts" mode. Setting this property
			has an immediate effect on modem only if
			TechnologyPreference is set to "umts" or "any".
			Otherwise the value is kept and applied whenever modem
			uses this mode.

			The possible values are:
				"any"		Frequency band is selected
						automatically by modem.
				"850"		Operate only on 850 MHz, known
						as CLR (class V).
				"900"		Operate only on 900 MHz, known
						as GSM (class VIII).
				"1700AWS"	Operate only on 1700 MHz, known
						as AWS (class IV).
				"1900"		Operate only on 1900 MHz, known
						as PCS (class II).
				"2100"		Operate only on 2100 MHz, known
						as IMT (class I).

		boolean	FastDormancy [readwrite, optional]

			This property will enable or disable the fast
			dormancy feature in the modem. Fast dormancy
			refers to a modem feature that allows the
			modem to quickly release radio resources after
			a burst of data transfer has ended. Normally,
			radio resources are released by the network
			after a timeout configured by the network.
			Fast dormancy allows the modem to release the
			radio resources more quickly.

			Fast dormancy is a major power-saving feature
			for mobile devices. Typically, fast dormancy
			would be enabled when the device is not being
			interactively used by a human user and only
			networking applications with keep-alive
			traffic are active (e.g. mail client or a
			presence application). In this case it is
			desirable to release radio resources quickly
			after a keep-alive transaction has ended,
			since typically no network traffic will occur
			until the next keep-alive transaction. Fast
			dormancy should not be enabled during
			interactive use because the release and setup
			of radio resources introduces perceivable
			delay for the end user.

			The fast dormancy implementation in the modem
			is vendor specific. The implementation should
			try to release radio resources more quickly,
			when the situation allows it, but should also
			take care not to increase the signalling load
			on the cellular network by releasing and
			re-establishing radio resources too often. The
			modem should adjust its behaviour to the 3GPP
			release supported by the network and the
			parameters set by the operator.

			Fast dormancy can be ignored for externally
			powered modems such as USB sticks or PCI
			devices. If the modem does not support such a
			feature the property should never be exposed
			to the user.
