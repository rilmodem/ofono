Modem hierarchy
===============

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.Modem
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns properties for the modem object. See
			the properties section for available properties.

		void SetProperty(string property, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as readwrite are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.NotImplemented
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotAvailable
					 [service].Error.AccessDenied
					 [service].Error.Failed

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	boolean Powered [readwrite]

			Boolean representing the power state of the modem
			device.

		boolean Online [readwrite]

			Boolean representing the rf state of the modem.
			Online is false in flight mode.

		boolean Lockdown [readwrite]

			Boolean representing the lock state of the modem.
			Setting it to true, makes the calling application hold
			the modem lock and power it down. Setting to false
			makes the it release the modem lock. Only the
			application that holds the lock can power up the modem.
			If the the application exits Lockdown is set to false.

		boolean Emergency [readonly, optional, experimental]

			Boolean representing the emergency mode of the
			modem. The Emergency is true if an emergency call or
			related operation is currently active.

		string Name [readonly, optional]

			Friendly name of the modem device.

		string Manufacturer [readonly, optional]

			String representing the manufacturer of the modem
			device.

			This is usually obtained by the +CGMI AT command.

		string Model [readonly, optional]

			String representing the model of the modem device.

			This is usually obtained by the +CGMM AT command.

		string Revision [readonly, optional]

			String representing the revision of the modem device.

			This is usually obtained by using the +CGMR AT command.

		string Serial [readonly, optional]

			String represeting the serial number of the modem
			device.

		array{string} Features [readonly]

			List of currently enabled features. It uses simple
			string abbreviations like "sms", "sim" etc.

		array{string} Interfaces [readonly]

			Set of interfaces currently supported by the mode
			device. The set depends on the state of the device
			(registration status, SIM inserted status,
			network capabilities, device capabilities, etc.)

			Please note that the set of Interfaces can and does
			change frequently (e.g. due to change in Powered
			and Online properties.)  If a given interface is no
			longer available, then the application should assume
			that all data for that interface has become invalid,
			e.g. calls have been dropped, network registration
			lost, etc.

		string Type [readonly]

			Indicates whether the modem is virtual or a real
			hardware one. This information should only be used
			to identify which componet (e.g. ConnMan or a phone
			dialer) should take control over the modem. It does
			not give any hints on which Interfaces will be
			supported by this modem.

			Possible values are "hfp", "sap" and "hardware".
